        <p>The daughter of Lord Selwyn Tarth, Lord of Evenfall Hall on the island of Tarth, Brienne endured a tumultuous childhood; losing a mother, brother and two sisters.</p>
        <p>As a result of her ungainly appearance, she suffered countless ridicule at the hands of her septa and scores of others. Either despite of this torment, or perhaps because of it, she grew to become one of the fiercest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
        <p>Her bravery and loyalty elevated her through the scattered ranks of those in power, ultimately landing her a knighthood and the role of Lord Commander of the Kingsguard to Bran the Broken.</p>
