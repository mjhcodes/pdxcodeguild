                <p>It was the Lebanese-born poet and painter, Kahlil Gibran, who once uttered, <em>"all our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind."</em></p>
                <p>They are thoughts thrust into existence. Actions have claimed to speak louder, the pen mightier, but true power continues to lay with the word. In its capacity to inspire and motivate, to denigrate and condemn.</p>
                <p>As part of my computer programming course at the PDX Code Guild, we were recently tasked with constructing a project to signal the shift of focus from the back-end to the front-end; from the approachable language of Python to the upcoming structure and artistry of HTML & CSS.</p>
                <!-- <p>The first few hours of contemplation were a struggle; a constant scene of head on desk, as I lingered in search of an idea at least partially unique. To my surprise and satisfaction, one ultimately came, and then the next.</p>
                <p>From politics to food to sports, potential plans were jotted into a Google Doc as quickly as my fingers could mash the keys. Some earned metaphorical pins for a later date; others shuffled over to a "just for fun" pile,  where I could tinker and toy without concern over deadline or significance.</p>
                <p>There was one, however, which stuck out. It felt timely and necessary; a series of  visual snapshots, targeting the curated minds of those who wish to lead us into the new decade. Those who vie for the top prize in a year when hindsight should be at its most formidable, yet will no doubt languish in nebulosity.</p> -->

                <h3>It's Not The Flashiest</h3>
                <p class="publish-date"><time datetime="2019-07-14 20:00">Sunday, July 14th, 2019</time></p>

                  </div>
                  <p>When I was preparing for my recent move to Portland and subsequent admission into a coding bootcamp, I was faced with a familiar foe: <em>anxiety</em>. Bootcamps are tough. It's there in the name. And although I didn't expect anything on the level of my previous participation in a <em>military</em> bootcamp all those years ago, I knew it was something to be taken seriously. It would require foresight and critical planning in order to be set up for success.</p>
                  <p>One step was to reach out to friends for advice. Fortunately, one of my best friends from childhood days had attended one of General Assembly's inaugural cohorts at the Seattle campus. His advice was fairly straight-forward: eat well, make time for exercise and don't sacrifice on sleep. The basic fundamentals to a happy and healthy life, right?</p>
                  <p>It was what he passed along next though that was the secret ingredient: <strong>FLASHCARDS</strong></p>
                  <!-- <p>I know, I know. Flashcards?! Blurgh. They're boring, they're tedious, but you know what else? They're effective. Flashcards promote active recall by requiring concepts to be retrieved from scratch. They provide immediate feedback on the accuracy of our assumptions and allow for <em>"piled prioritization"</em> based on our constantly shifting strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                  <p>During my first week at the PDX Code Guild, I kept a freshly purchased stack of Oxford Ruled Index Cards handy, waiting for the moment to strike when I'd tear open the wrapping and scribble across both front and back. <em>"Study, shuffle, repeat"</em> would be the mantra. Strangely, the opportunity didn't arise. I was confused. I knew the benefits, I was ready. I just wasn't sure where to begin.</p>
                  <p>And then, on one of those rare blue sky days in Oregon's capital, it hit me. Start anywhere, with anything. Just start. So that's what I have done, beginning with Python's built-in functions. On one side, the function. On the other, the syntax, its definition and usage, its parameters and, finally, an example.</p>
                  <p>Of the 68 built-in functions in Python, I have thus far completed just 15 flashcards, but have already become more familiar with what's lurking in that trusty old toolbox. Just the act of carefully reading and writing each letter by hand has helped the information become better engrained.</p>
                  <p>By the week's end, the rest of the deck will be complete. And then, it'll be on to methods, cross-language translation or whatever else strikes my fancy. Stacks on stacks on stacks may be a goal, but in order to achieve it, the stacks will first be comprised of index cards.</p> -->

                <h3>We Start With Zero</h3>
                <p class="publish-date"><time datetime="2019-07-07 20:00">Sunday, July 7th, 2019</time></p>

                  <p>It's difficult to know where to begin. After all, I, myself, am a beginner...</p>
                  <p>Tomorrow, I will walk through the doors of the PDX Code Guild to attend the 1st day of <s>the rest of my life</s>  the school's flagship Full Stack Developer Bootcamp; three months of full-time, intensive education. And then, the work truly begins, as I further inch toward my goal of transitioning from the world of hotels and customer service to that of computer programming.</p>
                  <p>Somewhere along the way, I happened to pick up a tip for those new to coding. It involved <i>"The Protégé Effect,"</i> the idea that the best way to learn a given subject is to teach it. From my experience coaching American football while rooted in Manchester, England, I can personally vouch for the accuracy of this claim. The depth of detail to which I was required to dive in order to simplify the sport to its most fundamental level was illuminating. It required flexibility, commitment, and, above all, patience. And, thus, in that spirit, this blog was born.</p>
                  <!-- <p>With today being the eve of the bootcamp's commencement, it felt appropriate to briefly touch on a topic often confusing to those new to the field: <strong>zero-based numbering.</strong></p>
                  <p>Unlike "normal" numbering systems, i.e. the everyday non-programming type, we do not begin the count at the number <em>one</em>, as you would with, say, the fingers on your hand. Instead, we start with the number <em>zero</em>. "Now, why on Earth would anyone count from zero?", you may ask. "After all, if we have zero of something, then we don't have anything at all!" Well, what it ultimately boils down to is efficiency. More specifically, the efficiency in the math.</p>
                  <p>Let's think about it this way... let's say we have the results of the men's 10,000 meter race from the 2016 Rio Olympics. If we slot the top five in an ordered list, it would appear as so: Farah, Tanui, Tola, Demelash & Rupp. Spread across sports pages far and wide, the results would read: Mo Farah - 27:05.17 - 1st place! And so on... down to, but not limited to, Galen Rupp in 5th. This makes sense to us. This seems logical. And, for all intents and purposes, it is.</p>
                  <p>When the computer interprets this data, however, it doesn't care about Mo's early plight as a refugee, nor the weight of the gold dangling from his neck. All the computer wants to do is slot Sir Mo in his place. To assign him, as the initial element, to the index of zero. When the Kenyan, the Ethiopians and the American streak across the finish line milliseconds later, they too gain an index position: 1 - 4, respectively.</p>
                  <p>In programming speak, the race's top five finishers could be summarized as such: <em>0 ≤ i < 5</em>. Less than five, yet greater than or equal to zero. If we had started the count at one, the formula would be: <em>1 ≤ i < 5 + 1</em>. A little clunky, no? Not to mention, less efficient.</p>
                  <p>When attempting to understand this alternative system, I have read tips with suggestions to simply add or subtract by one, as you bounce back and forth between the index position and the count itself. If you can manage to remember which method applies to which, then I guess this works.</p>
                  <p>The trick that has etched itself in my mind, however, doesn't involve any mental mathematics, but instead a rephrasing: "How many positions do you need to move to reach the item?" If we use Galen Rupp as an example, the answer is 4. If we use Mo Farah, the answer is 0. And, lo and behold, these are their indexed positions.</p>
                  <p>Another quick example? Stepping into a lift in England. Or, your age. When you were born, you weren't immediately dubbed as one. You were zero. Until 365 days later, when you shuffled on down to the next number.</p>
                  <p><em>(Heck, maybe I should've started with those... )</em></p> -->
